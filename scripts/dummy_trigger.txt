FORCED TEST TRIGGER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This is a dummy file created to force a real git diff
for testing the gemini_review_bridge.py token usage logging.

Test ID: DEEP-DIVE-AUDIT-$(date +%s)
Timestamp: $(date)

Purpose: Verify that the main bridge actually calls the API
and logs token usage properly.

Expected behavior:
1. File will be staged: git add scripts/dummy_trigger.txt
2. Bridge will detect a real diff
3. external_ai_review() will be called
4. API call will be made with GEMINI_API_KEY
5. Response will include usage metrics
6. Token usage log will appear in VERIFY_LOG.log

If this doesn't happen, it indicates:
- GEMINI_API_KEY is not set
- API is not being called
- Token logging logic has a bug
- Short-circuit in main() preventing API call
