# Feast Feature Store Configuration
# Task #042: Feature Store Implementation
# Feast Version: 0.10.2 (latest available)
# Date: 2025-12-29

project: mt5_crs_features
registry: registry.db
provider: local

# Online Store Configuration
# Feast 0.10.2 supports: SQLite (recommended for dev) or Datastore (for GCP)
# Redis/PostgreSQL not supported in 0.10.2 - would require newer Feast version
online_store:
  type: sqlite
  path: data/online.db

# Note on Offline Store:
# Feast 0.10.2 doesn't persist offline store configuration in YAML.
# Offline store is typically accessed directly by FeatureViews via their data sources.
# For PostgreSQL data access, use FileSource (Parquet/CSV exports) or BigQuerySource.
