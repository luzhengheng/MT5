## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't rush**: External AI review takes 60-90 minutes - this is normal for deep analysis

2. **Be specific**: If you want AI to focus on certain aspects, mention it in the prompt

3. **Save everything**: Keep all AI responses - you can reference them later

4. **Compare results**: If using multiple AIs, create a comparison document

5. **Follow up**: After getting results, you can ask follow-up questions to the same AI

---

## 📞 Import Results Back

After receiving AI review, import it back to the project:

```bash
# Save AI response to file first
python3 import_ai_review.py exports/ai_reviews/gemini_review_20251227.md
```

This will:
- Parse AI recommendations
- Create work order tickets in Notion
- Update project documentation
- Generate action items
